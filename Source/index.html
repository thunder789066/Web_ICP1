    <h1> A brief intro about me. </h1>
    <h2>
        My name is Christina Gerstner. This is my Senior year at University of
        Missouri - Kansas City. I spent the first year taking any and all the
        Anchor, Discourse, and Focus classes before actually taking any classes
        towards my degree. In the beginning, I was admitted to the CS BA degree
        instead of the BS degree. Once I had that switched out, I was ready to
        go and get started on my coding classes.

        In terms of prior experience with coding, I know or a have a brief knowledge
        in the following languages:
